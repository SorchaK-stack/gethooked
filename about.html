        <h1>How it Began</h1>
        <p>It all started after a long shift at work. Founder and CEO Sora Know grew bored of an ordinary evening watching TV, and decided to take up a new hobby. Hoping onto YouTube, she decovered the colorful and creative world of crochet. After purchasing her first hook and skein, she spent the rest of the night attempting to make her first chain. Gaining some practice, she started to challenge herself do more complex patterns and was made aware of just how large and appealing the community was. So Get Hooked was born, the collective online platform that would welcome any level of creative talent and encourage the pursuance of the crafts.</p>
